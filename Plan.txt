Controller needs to send off val 

Worker does a version of the analysis specific to one val, returns hist data
Controller reconstructs it and saves a plot of the histogram

Do all concatenation on controller at the end.         frames.append(ak.concatenate(sample_data))

    all_data[s] = ak.concatenate(frames) # dictionary entry is concatenated awkward arrays
